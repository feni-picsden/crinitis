Imagine twirling a forkful of linguine in a delicate garlic and olive oil infusion, the simplicity of the sauce allowing the pasta\u0026#8217;s natural elegance to shine through. Conversely, envisage rigatoni cradling a robust, slow-cooked meat ragù, each nook and cranny of the pasta capturing the rich, hearty flavors. This art of pairing pasta with sauces is where creativity meets tradition, resulting in a symphony of taste that lingers on the palate. 🎻🍷\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7277\" src=\"https://cp.crinitis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pi7_Image_GnocchiNapoli-610x480.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"413\" /\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"\u003eGnocchi Napoli, Source: Criniti’s\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we bid adieu to our pasta journey, let\u0026#8217;s savour the unique delights of gnocchi and orecchiette.

Using a sharp knife, make a cross on top of the tomatoes, place them in the boiling water, and cook for around 10 minutes. When cooked and soft, drain tomatoes and set aside to cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen cooled, peel off the skin beginning at the cross marked on the tops. Place tomatoes into a blender and give them a quick blitz. Set pulped tomato to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat oil in a large heavy-based pot to medium heat and add onion, garlic, and chili (optional). Stir this until the aroma of the garlic has made its way to your nose. Add the minced meat and fry gently, releasing the flavors. Add the veal chop and brown slightly. Then add the pureed tomatoes, wine, and half the quantity of water. Combine well. Bring to a boil for 8 to 10 minutes, which allows the alcohol in the wine to cook off, as you don’t want it to dominate the sauce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReduce heat to low and cook the sauce for around an hour and a half, stirring every 20 minutes and gradually adding the remaining water with each stir. Add sugar to neutralize the acid in the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and a sprinkling of oregano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10 minutes before the end of the cooking, add the bay leaves, as they will release a little bit more love into the sauce. Stir ragu through your favorite pasta, sprinkle with parmesan and serve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIP: Stirring the sauce while it’s simmering will prevent it from becoming bitter. Cook your pasta al dente, as this will complement the dish more than words can express, and we personally only use spaghetti or a very thin linguini.
