Here, the Criniti family first combined their passion for fine-quality food with a unique dining concept. The aspiration to share and celebrate their culinary heritage saw the restaurant quickly become a popular spot amongst locals.</p>\n<p>The unique blend of traditional southern Italian and contemporary Australian cuisine captivated patrons&#8217; taste buds and hearts. This authentic dining experience with a twist soon drew attention beyond the boundaries of Parramatta. Patrons started traveling from all corners of Sydney to taste what all the &#8216;fuss&#8217; was about.</p>\n<p>Our venues are open seven days a week for lunch and dinner, so we invite you to explore and ignite your senses with our varied and crowd-pleasing dishes.

It&#8217;s a bond that should be cherished and remembered. That&#8217;s why we say, when you&#8217;re here, you&#8217;re family… salute! Join us to celebrate our 20th anniversary, and who knows?
