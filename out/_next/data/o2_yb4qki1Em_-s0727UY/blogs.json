Alternatively, let them wade through a hearty, wild mushroom ragù, their wide surface area capturing earthy flavors in every bite. Fettuccine and pappardelle don&#8217;t just carry sauce; they elevate it to a crescendo of culinary delight.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7275\" src=\"https://cp.crinitis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pi7_Image_pennesoprano-610x480.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"413\" /><em><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Penne Soprano, Source: Criniti’s</span></em></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Next up, let&#8217;s venture into the world of tubes &#8211; penne and rigatoni.

Picture them cradling vibrant, chunky vegetable sauces or embracing hearty, meat-based concoctions. They bring a delightful contrast of textures, with each bite offering a satisfying combination of tender pasta and robust, flavourful sauce. Penne and rigatoni are like culinary conduits, ensuring that every mouthful is a harmonious symphony of taste and texture. 🍲🥩</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7276\" src=\"https://cp.crinitis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pi7_Image_raviolimonica-610x480.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"413\" /><em><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Ravioli Monica, Source: Criniti’s</span></em></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s explore pasta&#8217;s hidden treasures &#8211; ravioli and tortellini. These delicate parcels are like small, edible presents, each one concealing a burst of flavor and creativity. Picture ravioli filled with creamy ricotta and vibrant spinach, a bite-sized ode to comfort and indulgence. Tortellini, on the other hand, are like culinary love notes, crafted with precision and care. They cradle flavors like sumptuous lobster or rich cheese, each bite a revelation of taste and texture. Ravioli and tortellini are the artisans of the pasta world, transforming each plate into a canvas of culinary artistry. 🎨🦐🧀</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Pairing pasta shapes with the right sauces is akin to orchestrating a perfect symphony. It&#8217;s about harmonizing textures, flavors, and visual appeal to create a culinary masterpiece. Imagine twirling a forkful of linguine in a delicate garlic and olive oil infusion, the simplicity of the sauce allowing the pasta&#8217;s natural elegance to shine through. Conversely, envisage rigatoni cradling a robust, slow-cooked meat ragù, each nook and cranny of the pasta capturing the rich, hearty flavors. This art of pairing pasta with sauces is where creativity meets tradition, resulting in a symphony of taste that lingers on the palate. 🎻🍷</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7277\" src=\"https://cp.crinitis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pi7_Image_GnocchiNapoli-610x480.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"413\" /><em><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Gnocchi Napoli, Source: Criniti’s</span></em></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Before we bid adieu to our pasta journey, let&#8217;s savour the unique delights of gnocchi and orecchiette.

Its origins can be traced back to the early 20th century, when Count Camillo Negroni asked a bartender at Caffè Casoni in Florence to strengthen his favourite cocktail, the Americano, by adding gin instead of the usual soda water. The result was a bold and aromatic cocktail that quickly gained popularity and became known as the Negroni.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the Negroni has become a staple of Italian culture and can be found on menus at bars and restaurants all over the country. One of the best places to enjoy a classic Negroni is at Criniti&#8217;s restaurant, which has locations in Southbank, Carlton, Brighton Le Sand, Parramatta (new location 328 Church st) Wetherill Park, Kotara, and Castle Hills. At Criniti&#8217;s, you&#8217;ll find a wide selection of Negronis made with the finest ingredients, as well as a variety of other classic cocktails and aperitivi.</p>\n<p>In addition to their delicious cocktails, Criniti&#8217;s is also known for its wood-fired pizzas and fresh pasta, making it the perfect place to enjoy a delicious meal while sipping on a classic Negroni. Whether you&#8217;re a fan of the classic cocktail or are looking to try something new, a visit to Criniti&#8217;s is a must when in Italy. So the next time you&#8217;re in the area, be sure to stop by and experience the magic of the Negroni and all that Crinitis has to offer.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6549\" src=\"https://static.crinitis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29132935/matheus-frade-OJfH_H-DoDA-unsplash-scaled-e1672281117618.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crinitis.com.au/locations\">BOOK A TABLE</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Negroni is a classic Italian cocktail that has been enjoyed for over a century.

One bite will transport you to a culinary paradise and satisfy your craving for classic Italian cuisine.</p>\n<p>This simple dish has been adopted worldwide, and everyone seems to have their own take on bolognese. Here is the best bolognese recipe to take you to the rustic southern Italian place our family called home.</p>\n<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong><br />\n10 Ripe Roma tomatoes<br />\n½ Cup olive oil<br />\n1 Onion, diced<br />\n2 Garlic cloves, crushed and chopped<br />\n1 Birdseye chili, sliced<br />\n150g Lean beef mince<br />\n1 Veal or Pork chop<br />\n¼ Cup red wine<br />\n1 Teaspoon sugar<br />\n4 Basil leaves<br />\n1 Bay leaf<br />\n1 Cup water<br />\nSalt and pepper<br />\nSprinkle dried oregano</p>\n<p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Using a sharp knife, make a cross on top of the tomatoes, place them in the boiling water, and cook for around 10 minutes. When cooked and soft, drain tomatoes and set aside to cool.</p>\n<p>When cooled, peel off the skin beginning at the cross marked on the tops. Place tomatoes into a blender and give them a quick blitz. Set pulped tomato to one side.</p>\n<p>Heat oil in a large heavy-based pot to medium heat and add onion, garlic, and chili (optional). Stir this until the aroma of the garlic has made its way to your nose. Add the minced meat and fry gently, releasing the flavors. Add the veal chop and brown slightly. Then add the pureed tomatoes, wine, and half the quantity of water. Combine well. Bring to a boil for 8 to 10 minutes, which allows the alcohol in the wine to cook off, as you don’t want it to dominate the sauce.</p>\n<p>Reduce heat to low and cook the sauce for around an hour and a half, stirring every 20 minutes and gradually adding the remaining water with each stir. Add sugar to neutralize the acid in the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and a sprinkling of oregano.</p>\n<p>10 minutes before the end of the cooking, add the bay leaves, as they will release a little bit more love into the sauce. Stir ragu through your favorite pasta, sprinkle with parmesan and serve.</p>\n<p>TIP: Stirring the sauce while it’s simmering will prevent it from becoming bitter. Cook your pasta al dente, as this will complement the dish more than words can express, and we personally only use spaghetti or a very thin linguini. Don’t forget to use good-quality parmesan.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6473\" src=\"https://static.crinitis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/05003045/blog-3-bolognese-ragu-410x330.jpg\" alt=\"Bolognese Ragu\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crinitis.com.au/locations\"><span style=\"color: #33cccc;\"><strong>BOOK A TABLE</strong></span></a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Behold the secret of Italy&#8217;s most delicious dish: Criniti family Bolognese Ragu!

for its woodfired meter-long pizzas, big pasta bowls, and extensive Italian menu. But what you might not know is the story behind the dishes on their menu.</p>\n<p>At Criniti&#8217;s, every family member is essential, and this philosophy is reflected in the company&#8217;s motto: &#8220;When you&#8217;re here, you&#8217;re family.&#8221; This is why the owners took great care in curating their menu, ensuring that there is something for everyone – whether you&#8217;re a seafood lover, a health-conscious diner, a picky eater, a vegan, or someone who craves meaty dishes like ribs, burgers, and steak.
